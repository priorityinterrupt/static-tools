PROJECT: static-tools 
VERSION: 0.1
CREATED BY: Justin Derleth <justin@techsage.net>

DESCRIPTION: 

These are static binaries compiled by myself for personal use when auditing
potentially compromised servers. While I have no intention of supporting
these tools in any sort of offical capacity I am more than happy to recieve
any comments or suggestions if you do use them. These can be sent to
justin@techsage.net

Everything here is open source and the use of each tool is restricted
only by the respective license of each tool. Minor modifications have
been made when nessarry to allow for a succesfull compile. Those changed
will be noted.   

EXAMPLE

./static-tools/chkrootkit-0.49/chkrootkit -p ../bin
